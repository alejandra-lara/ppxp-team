  - reference: .isolated_router.static_ips
    label: Router IPs
    description: "Enter static IP address(es) for the Router(s), which must be within the subnet CIDR block that you defined in the Ops Manager network configuration. If you have a load balancer, configure it to point to these IPs."
  - reference: .isolated_diego_cell.garden_network_pool
    label: Applications Subnet (Only change this if you need to avoid address collision with a third-party service on the same subnet.)
    description: Enter a CIDR subnet mask specifying the range of available IP addresses to be assigned to your app containers. This must be different from the network used by the system VMs.
  - reference: .isolated_diego_cell.garden_network_mtu
    label: Applications Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) (in bytes)
    description: The default 1454 bytes is fine for most cases, but you might need less, such as for networks that use GRE tunnels.

            description: Router ciphers are read in Golang and should use underscores instead of dashes in their names e.g. TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

        label: "Forward unencrypted traffic to Elastic Runtime Router. Assumes an external load balancer is configured to forward unencrypted traffic."
