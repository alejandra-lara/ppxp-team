      label: Whitelist for non-RFC-1918 Private Networks
      description: 'If your Elastic Runtime deployment is using a private network that is not RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), then you must type in "allow <your-network>;" here. It is important to include the word "allow" and the semi-colon at the end. Multiple rules should be separated by a comma. For example, "allow 172.99.0.0/24;,allow 172.55.0.0/24;"'
      placeholder: "e.g.: allow 172.99.0.0/24;,allow 172.55.0.0/24;"

              label: Network CIDR
              description: Defines the range of the overlay network. The CIDR must specify a RFC 1918 range. Defaults to 10.255.0.0/16.

              label: Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) (in bytes)
              description: Sets the MTU for the container networking driver. Leaving this unset will use the driver default value.

          label: Disable Container-to-Container Networking
    - reference: .properties.cc_api_rate_limit
      label: Enabling CF API Rate Limiting will prevent API consumers from overwhelming the platform API servers. Limits are imposed on a per-user or per-client basis and reset on an hourly interval.
