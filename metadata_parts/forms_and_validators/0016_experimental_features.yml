  label: Experimental Features
  description: These are several features that may require a greater understanding of Cloud Foundry system components and their more recently introduced capabilities.
  markdown: |
  ## You can specify how much memory or disk you want to set as the Diego Cells' available capacity. You can overcommit these resources with values that exceed the Diego Cell VM sizes configured in the Resource Config section.
  ## TCP Routing allows you to map TCP routes to your apps. You will need to setup a TCP load balancer and domain to support this feature.
  ## Unprivileged containers greatly improve security as root escalation inside application containers no longer threaten the host operating system, however you should enable this feature only after you've tested that this will not break integration workloads.

    - reference: .diego_brain.disable_privileged_containers
      label: Disable privileged app containers
      description: This determines whether or not to use privileged containers for your apps. Containers based on Docker images however are always unprivileged. Otherwise, this setting only applies to newly pushed apps, so you must restart any pre-existing apps that you want to adopt a new setting.
    - reference: .tcp_router.static_ips
      label: TCP Router IPs
      description: "Enter the IP address(es) you would like to designate for the TCP Routers. The addresses must be within your subnet CIDR block. Point your load balancer to these address(es)."
    - reference: .properties.tcp_routing
      label: Enable TCP requests to your apps via specific ports on the TCP router. You will want to configure a load balancer to forward these TCP requests to the TCP routers. If you do not have a load balancer, then you can also send traffic directly to the TCP router.
      selector_property_inputs:
        - reference: .properties.tcp_routing.disable
          label: Select this option if you prefer to enable TCP Routing at a later time
        - reference: .properties.tcp_routing.enable
          label: Enable TCP Routing
          property_inputs:
            - reference: .properties.tcp_routing.enable.reservable_ports
              label: TCP Routing Ports (one-time configuration, if you want to update this value you can via the CF CLI)
              description: Enter the range of ports reserved for TCP routes. These ports must be available on your load balancer. You can specify a list of ports with commas between each port number and specify ranges of ports with dashes between the first and last port number. This configuration only applies the first time you specify it here, if you later want to update the ports you must do so with the CF CLI.
