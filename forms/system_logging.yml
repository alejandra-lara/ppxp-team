  Optionally configure rsyslog to forward platform component logs
  to an external service.
  If you do not fill these fields,
  platform logs will not be forwarded
  but will remain available on the component VMs
  and for download via Ops Manager.

property_inputs:
- reference: .properties.syslog_host
  label: Address
  description: |
    The aggregator must be reachable from the Application Service network, accept
    TCP, UDP or RELP connections, and use the RELP protocol (e.g. rsyslogd).
    You can also configure this with an IP address.

- reference: .properties.syslog_port
  label: Port
  description: |
    The typical syslogd port is 514. Ensure syslogd is listening on external
    interfaces.

- reference: .properties.syslog_protocol
  label: Transport Protocol
  description: Select the transport protocol for forwarding logs.

- reference: .properties.syslog_tls
  label: Encrypt syslog using TLS?
  selector_property_inputs:
  - reference: .properties.syslog_tls.disabled
    label: "No"

  - reference: .properties.syslog_tls.enabled
    label: "Yes"
    property_inputs:
    - reference: .properties.syslog_tls.enabled.tls_permitted_peer
      label: Permitted Peer
      description: |
        Either the accepted fingerprint (SHA1) or name of remote peer, e.g.
        *.example.com.

    - reference: .properties.syslog_tls.enabled.tls_ca_cert
      label: TLS CA Certificate
      description: |
        This certificate will ensure that logs get securely transported to
        the syslog destination.

- reference: .doppler.message_drain_buffer_size
  label: Syslog Drain Buffer Size (# of messages)
  description: |
    The number of log messages the buffer holds before dropping messages. A
    larger buffer size might overload the system.

- reference: .properties.syslog_metrics_to_syslog_enabled
  label: Include container metrics in SysLog Drains
  description: |
    Receive container metrics delivered in create-user-provided-service
    (CUPS) Syslog Drain bindings.

- reference: .cloud_controller.security_event_logging_enabled
  label: Enable Cloud Controller security event logging
  description: |
    When enabled, all requests to Cloud Controller will be captured in the
    syslog

- reference: .properties.syslog_use_tcp_for_file_forwarding_local_transport
  label: Use TCP for file forwarding local transport
  description: |
    Workaround to avoid truncation of very long
    (> 1024 bytes)
    log lines.
    May negatively impact performance.

- reference: .properties.syslog_rule
  label: Custom rsyslog Configuration
  description: |
    Accepts configuration for rsyslog
    in the rainerscript syntax.
    For example,
    'if ($app-name startswith "exampleComponent") then {~}'
    can be used to drop all traffic
    from a particular component.
    Entered configuration will be applied
    prior to the forwarding rule.
