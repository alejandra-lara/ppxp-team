    Configure security and routing services for your isolation segment.

  - reference: .isolated_diego_cell.garden_network_mtu
    label: |
      Applications Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) (in bytes)
    description: |
      The default 1454 bytes is fine for most cases, but you might need less,
      such as for networks that use GRE tunnels.

    label: Router IPs
    description: |
      If you are deploying onto an infrastructure that does not support
      automated assignment of routers to load balancers (vSphere), or you are
      intending to manually configure your load balancer with the IP
      addresses of the routers, you should enter static IP addresses here
      that will be used by the routers. On infrastructures where automated
      load balancer assignment is supported (AWS, GCP, Azure), this field can
      be left blank and the "Load Balancers" field on the "Resource Config"
      tab can be filled out with the correct load balancer assignment.

  - reference: .properties.networking_poe_ssl_cert
    label: Certificate and Private Key for Router
    description: |
      This certificate and key are used to terminate SSL traffic at the
      Router. The certificate can have multiple domains attributed
      to it, for example if you have separate system and application
      domains. You can also generate a self-signed certificate here
      with your wildcard system domain.

    label: TLS Cipher Suites for Router
    description: |
      An ordered, colon-delimited list of Golang supported TLS cipher suites in
      OpenSSL format, e.g. "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-
      SHA384"

      Host port used for receiving VXLAN packets. Defaults to 4789.

  - reference: .properties.routing_table_sharding_mode
    label: "Router Sharding Mode: When 'Isolation Segment Only' is selected, the routers of this tile will only have knowledge of applications deployed to the Cells of this tile; all other requests will receive a 404 response. When 'No Isolation Segments' is selected, the routers of this tile will reject requests for any isolation segment. Choose 'No Isolation Segments' to add a group of routers for the Elastic Runtime tile, as when a private point of entry for the system domain is desired."

               Denied traffic logging is rate limited. Override the

            label: UDP logging interval (packets/second)

              UDP traffic logging is rate limited. Override the
              default of 100 packets/second.

  - reference: .properties.router_forward_client_cert
    label: |
      Configure the CF Router support for the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header.
      Setting this field to an option other than "Always forward" will
      change the behavior for how the Router handles the
      x-forwarded-client-cert (XFCC) HTTP header. This header can be used
      by applications to verify the requester via mutual TLS.
    selector_property_inputs:
      - reference: .properties.router_forward_client_cert.always_forward
        label: Always forward the XFCC header in the request, regardless of whether the client connection is mTLS
      - reference: .properties.router_forward_client_cert.forward
        label: Forward the XFCC header received from the client only when the client connection is mTLS
      - reference: .properties.router_forward_client_cert.sanitize_set
        label: Strip the XFCC header when present and set it to the client certificate from the mTLS handshake

  - reference: .properties.router_backend_max_conn
    label: Max Connections Per Backend
    description: |
      Maximum concurrent TCP connections per backend for each instance of
      the Router. A value of 0 means unlimited.
