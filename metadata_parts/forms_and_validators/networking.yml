  - reference: .isolated_router.static_ips
    label: Router IPs
    description: "Enter static IP address(es) for the Router(s), which must be within the subnet CIDR block that you defined in the Ops Manager network configuration. If you have a load balancer, configure it to point to these IPs."
  - reference: .isolated_diego_cell.garden_network_mtu
    label: Applications Network Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) (in bytes)
    description: The default 1454 bytes is fine for most cases, but you might need less, such as for networks that use GRE tunnels.

            description: Router ciphers are read in Golang and should use underscores instead of dashes in their names e.g. TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA:TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
      - reference: .properties.networking_point_of_entry.terminate_at_router_ert_cert
        label: "Forward SSL to Isolation Segment Router with ERT Router certificates. Assumes an external load balancer is configured to forward encrypted traffic. Will inherit the certificates provided to the Router in the Elastic Runtime Tile."

            label: Network CIDR
            description: Defines the range of the overlay network. The CIDR must specify a RFC 1918 range. Defaults to 10.255.0.0/16.

            label: Applications Subnet (Only change this if you need to avoid address collision with a third-party service on the same subnet.)
            description: Enter a CIDR subnet mask specifying the range of available IP addresses to be assigned to your app containers. This must be different from the network used by the system VMs.
  - reference: .isolated_router.enable_isolated_routing
    label: Only route traffic for this Isolation Segment
    description: When enabled, the routers of this tile will only have knowledge of applications deployed to the Cells of this tile; all other requests will receive a 404 response. When disabled, the routers of this tile will reject requests for any isolation segment. Choose this option to add a group of routers for the Elastic Runtime tile, as when a private point of entry for the system domain is desired.
