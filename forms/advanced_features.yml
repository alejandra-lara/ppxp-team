  You can specify how much memory or disk you want to set as the Diego Cells'
  available capacity. You can overcommit these resources with values that
  exceed the Diego Cell VM sizes configured in the Resource Config section.

      If your Application Service deployment is using a private network that is
      not RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), then you must
      type in "allow <your-network>;" here. It is important to include the
      word "allow" and the semi-colon at the end. Multiple rules should be
      separated by a comma. For example, "allow 172.99.0.0/24;,allow
      172.55.0.0/24;"

  - reference: .properties.cloud_controller_temporary_disable_deployments
    label: Disable Zero Downtime App Deployments

      queries. It is recommended to make this number no higher than you need
      for your use case.
