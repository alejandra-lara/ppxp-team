    Elastic Runtime hosts applications at subdomains under its apps domain and
    assigns system components to subdomains under its system domain. You need
    to configure a wildcard DNS for both the apps domain and system domain. The
    two domains can be the same, although this is not recommended.

        This domain is for system-level PCF components, such as the API, UAA,
        or Apps Manager. You must set up a wildcard DNS record for this domain
        that points to your entry point load balancer or HAProxy as configured
        on the Networking tab.

        This domain is the default domain that applications will use for their
        hostnames. This domain also requires a wildcard DNS record. Use the
        Cloud Foundry command line interface (cf CLI) to add or delete
        subdomains assigned to individual apps.
