  You can specify how much memory or disk you want to set as the Diego Cells'
  available capacity. You can overcommit these resources with values that
  exceed the Diego Cell VM sizes configured in the Resource Config section.

  - reference: .diego_cell.executor_memory_capacity
    label: Cell Memory Capacity (MB)

  - reference: .diego_cell.executor_disk_capacity
    label: Cell Disk Capacity (MB)

  - reference: .nfs_server.blobstore_internal_access_rules
    label: Whitelist for non-RFC-1918 Private Networks
    description: |
      If your Application Service deployment is using a private network that is
      not RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), then you must
      type in "allow <your-network>;" here. It is important to include the
      word "allow" and the semi-colon at the end. Multiple rules should be
      separated by a comma. For example, "allow 172.99.0.0/24;,allow
      172.55.0.0/24;"

      e.g.: allow 172.99.0.0/24;,allow 172.55.0.0/24;

  - reference: .properties.cf_dial_timeout_in_seconds
    label: CF CLI Connection Timeout

      Max wait time to establish a connection, including name resolution, in
      seconds.

  - reference: .properties.enable_log_cache
    label: Enable log-cache
    description: |
      Log cache enables more responsive retrieval of logging and metrics for
      apps and is a dependency for some newer features like autoscaling

  - reference: .properties.enable_cf_metric_name
    label: Use "cf" as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name
    description: |
      This option will be removed in a future release. Only enable this when it
      is required for backward compatibility with previous versions of PCF.  If
      this option is toggled and PCF Healthwatch is installed, enable the PCF
      Healthwatch Push Monitoring Components Errand to ensure correct PCF
      Healthwatch configuration. Refer to the Known Issues section of PCF
      Healthwatch Release Notes for details.

  - reference: .properties.enable_smb_volume_driver
    label: Enable SMB volume services
    description: |
      Enabling SMB volume services will allow application developers to bind
      existing SMB shares to their applications for shared file access.
      Also requires enabling the SMB Broker Errand as it is disabled by default.

  - reference: .properties.enable_tls_to_internal_pxc
    label: "BETA: Enable TLS for internal system database"
    description: |
      When checked, PAS components which support TLS will connect to the
      internal PXC database using an encrypted TLS connection.

  - reference: .properties.diego_database_max_open_connections
    label: Maximum number of open connections from the active BBS instance to the SQL database
    description: |
      Configures the maximum number of concurrent database connections the
      active BBS instance is allowed to have. Warning, changing this value may
      affect the amount of time it takes for the BBS to respond to requests.
    placeholder: 100

  - reference: .properties.locket_database_max_open_connections
    label: Maximum number of open connections from each Locket instance to the SQL database
    description: |
      Configures the maximum number of concurrent database connections each
      Locket instance is allowed to have. Warning, changing this value may
      affect the amount of time it takes for Locket to respond to requests.

  - reference: .properties.silk_database_max_open_connections
    label: Maximum number of open connections from each Silk Controller instance to the SQL database
    description: |
      Configures the maximum number of concurrent database connections each
      Silk Controller instance is allowed to have. Warning, changing this value may
      affect the amount of time it takes for the Silk Controller to respond to requests.

  - reference: .properties.cloud_controller_temporary_disable_deployments
    label: Disable Zero Downtime App Deployments
    description: |
      This option will be removed in a future release. This will disable zero-downtime deployments for applications
      as well as the cc_deployment_updater job.
