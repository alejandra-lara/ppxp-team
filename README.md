Deploys garden cells (running windows server 2016) for all of your windows app needs

## Is there CI?

Yup, it is located [here](https://releng.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/wrt-2016::2.0)

## What you need to deploy it

- Elastic Runtime
- Windows Specific Stemcell

## How we test it

- Running [WATs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/wats)
